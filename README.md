# Pac-Man Dynamic Background

# [PREVIEW (CLICK HERE)](https://pac-man-dynamic-background.vercel.app/)

## Overview
The **Pac-Man Dynamic Background** is a visually engaging and interactive animation that mimics classic arcade mechanics while responding dynamically to user input. It creates a **procedural maze**, generates floating particles, and features an autonomous Pac-Man that navigates towards the user's cursor using an intelligent pathfinding algorithm.

## Key Features

### 🎨 **Procedural Maze Generation**
The background is constructed using a randomly generated maze grid that changes on each page load. Different **color schemes** inspired by classic arcade aesthetics are applied dynamically, ensuring **variation** in each session.

### 🌀 **Particle Effects & User Interaction**
- The animation includes **floating particles**, which add depth and movement to the scene.
- Particles react to the **user's cursor**, creating a subtle attraction effect that adds dynamism and immersion.

### 🟡 **Autonomous Pac-Man Movement**
Pac-Man **seeks and follows** the user's cursor across the screen using a **pathfinding algorithm**.  
- He calculates the optimal path dynamically to avoid walls and navigate efficiently.
- Movement is fluid, mimicking classic game physics with animated mouth motion.

### 🏁 **Pathfinding Logic**
Pac-Man utilizes the **A* algorithm** to determine the shortest path to the cursor’s position.  
- The system continuously recalculates the optimal route based on user movements.
- Ensures natural and responsive behavior, enhancing interactivity.

### ⚡ **Performance Optimization**
- Animation frames are rendered dynamically to maintain **smooth motion**.
- **Resize detection** ensures the background adjusts perfectly to different screen sizes.
- Optimized calculations prevent lag, making the experience seamless.

## Why This Is Ingenious 🎮
- **Procedural generation** means every instance of the background is unique.
- **Interactive particles** create a reactive user experience.
- **Autonomous AI-driven movement** gives Pac-Man lifelike behavior.
- **Classic arcade nostalgia** meets modern web animation techniques.

This project **blends artificial intelligence, animation, and user engagement seamlessly**, making it more than just a visual effect—it's a **playable experience embedded within a background**. 🚀
